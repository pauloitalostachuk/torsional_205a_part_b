# torsional_205a_part_b
This repository contains experimental signals obtained in a torsional control system, ECP Systems model 205a. All the experimental procedures were performed with sine waves with different frequencies and amplitudes.

The files are organized:
1 column: Sample;
2 column: Time; 
3 column: Comanded Pos;
4 column: Encoder 1 Pos; 
5 column: Encoder 2 Pos; 
6 column: Encoder 3 Pos; 
7 column: Control Effort;
